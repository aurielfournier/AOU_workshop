## Auriel's notes 

today we are going to learn about data management and plotting, specifically plotting in ggplot2 (often just called ggplot). 

managing  your data in a tidy format makes manipulation easier, often makes your data clearer, and it forces you to think about your data. Which is **very** important. 

first we are going to cover data management, one, because you should manage your data before you do anything else, and two, because if you don't, ggpot won't talk to you.

for both data management and plotting there is a learning curve, I sucked at this first, you might as well, its part of the process.
