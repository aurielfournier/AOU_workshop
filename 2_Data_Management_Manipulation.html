<h1>Data Cleaning, Management and Manipulation</h1>
<p>If you talk to people who hate R chances are (if they have used R) the reason they hate it has nothing to do with R, and EVERYTHING to do with data management.</p>
<p>R is not excel, it will never be excel, and for that we can all be grateful. But if the only way you have ever interacted with data is through excel obviously R is a totally different ballgame.</p>
<p>One of the big complaints I hear is ‘R doesn’t read excel files’</p>
<ul>
<li>first - this is not true (there are packages that let you read in excel files)</li>
<li>second - if you have your data in a CLEAN AND MANAGED FORM you can save your excel file as a txt or csv or tsv and EASILY import it into R.<br /></li>
<li>third - people like to hate on R (just like I love to love on R)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are many things you can do AS YOU ENTER <em>and</em> PROOF your data to make your life easier (EVEN IF YOU DONT USE R)</em></p>
<p>Ideally you will do all your data analysis of one dataset <em>without</em> splitting the dataset up into little pieces</p>
<div id="tips-for-getting-data-into-r-without-wanting-to-destroy-things" class="section level3">
<h3>tips for getting data into R without wanting to destroy things</h3>
<ul>
<li>NO SPACES <em>especially in column headers</em></li>
<li>do not start column headers with numbers</li>
<li>keep EVERYTHING LOWER CASE unless you have a really good reason</li>
<li>you CAN use underscores “_&quot; or periods “.” but really running things together <em>intooneword</em> is better</li>
</ul>

<div id="talk-about-metadata-and-why-scripting-data-cleaningmanagement-is-a-great-idea." class="section level3">
<h3>Talk about metadata and why scripting data cleaning/management is a <em>great</em> idea.</h3>
<ul>
<li>good metadata - your most important collaborator is yourself six months ago, so leave yourself good notes, since you can’t send yourself six months ago an email. You and anyone who uses your data/code later on with thank you.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning in R</h3>
<ul>
<li>read your data into R
<ul>
<li>sometimes this is an entire excercise in and of itself if you have ever been given a dataset that is spread across X number of spreadsheets</li>
<li>IF you can get all the spreadsheets into excel, script your process of hooking them together. First you want to clean each one individually and then use some of the techniques below to stitch them together into one big file</li>
</ul></li>
<li>look at the structure, make sure R read things in the way you think (numbers are numbers especially)</li>
<li>chances are if R read something in ‘wrong’ then there is somethign funky in your data (like some letters in a numeric column)</li>
<li>now look for impossible and improbable data. Often the easiest way to do this is the summary() function and check the max/min and see if either is impossible or improbable. Deal with those accordingly.</li>
<li>this is more difficult for factors, the unique() function can be helpful for you to visually assess if you have any <em>slightly different</em> factors (mingoNWR vs MingoNWR) and you can edit accordingly</li>
<li>all of these changes should be made in R, and shoudl be scripted, and written out to a new clean file</li>
<li>DO NOT CHANGE THE RAW DATA</li>
<li>Save your scripts for data cleaning/data manipulation and if you remove any part of the data make comments within the script explaining why so that future you can remember, future you is an idiot, comment accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h3>pipes</h3>
<p>often when doing data management you want to do a series of things to a data frame, without having each thing you do assigned to a new, or constantly over writing object. One way you can do this is with pipes %&gt;% which are part of the tidyr and dplyr packages. So you can load either package to get pipes.</p>
<p>%&gt;% pipes let you string together multiple functions by taking the output from the last function and making it the first argument of the next one. This prevents you from having to rewrite over your previous object (which can cause issues if the function doesn’t work the way you think it will the first time) and/or keeps you from creating tons of intermediate objects that you then have to keep track of. You will have to load</p>

<h1>Effort correction</h1>
<div id="section-1" class="section level32">
<p></p>
<p>before we go comparing counts for a given species we need to think about the effort that went into creaeting those numbers</p>
<p>the simplest way to account for this is to correct for the number of kilometers covered(there are other ways, but for today, we’ll tackle this way).</p>

<p>ok, so this is all good and fine, but we have a lot of NAs which aren’t very informative.</p>
<p>how do we subset our data to get rid of these NA’s and their corresponding data?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>myebird &lt;- myebird %&gt;% filter(!is.na(effortcount))</code></pre>
<p>tadah! NAs are gone.</p>
<p>there are functions which will do this, na.omit() to the entire data frame but when you only want to remove NAs from a particular column it is often easier to phrase it this way.</p>

<p>Do not edit your raw data file. When doing initial management and cleaning you will likely create a new cleaned and ready to go file. Then when you go to do analysis you will work from this new clean file. There is no reason to break up this new data into lots of smaller data files. When you go to do some analysis read in the clean file, and subset it within R to do what you need to do. We’ve already talked about subsetting, use those skills to subset your data within R to accomplish your tasks, do not create a bajillion csv files.</p>

<div id="wide-vs-long-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Wide vs Long Data</h3>
<p>People often like to look at data in long format, but R likes data in long format. Luckily its fairly easy in R to move between the two.</p>
<p>Wide format is where each unit (lets say a vegetation point) is a row, and each column is a variable (site, date, water depth, etc, etc)</p>
<p>(examples of wide data, since gapminder is already in long format)</p>

<p>Long format has an identification column (vegetation point id #) and two other columns, variable (the name of the variable “water depth, site, etc”) and one for value (the value for that vegetation point and that variable)</p>
<p>The advantage of long format data is it is easier to summarize and reform into graphs, tables, and to perform analysis.</p>
